IClojure is an Interactive Clojure repl, inspired by IPython.

License: Eclipse Public License (EPL), same as Clojure.


Features:

* Tab completion, based on http://github.com/ninjudd/clojure-complete, itself based on swank-clojure.
* Shorthand for source and doc
* Shorthand for introspecting Java objects and classes via reflection
* Proper Control-C handling, although not very portable


Tab completion:

* variable
* method invocations
* "(.method" completion for all java methods for any of the classes in the current namespace
* "(. object method" completion for all the methods of the object (or a form that evaluates to an object)


Other shorthands:

  ?symbol    => (doc symbol)
  ??symbol   => (source symbol)
  %d symbol  => show constructors, methods and fields of the given object or Class

Roadmap:

* input caching, similar to IPython
* output caching, similar to IPython
* persist history across sessions to ~/.iclojure_history
* more advanced auto-completions
